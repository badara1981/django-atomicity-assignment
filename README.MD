Create a django project, provide the necessary model and template files to get a simple transfer application working between 2 customers.

Always blacken your files (i.e. Use PEP8 rules where possible).
If you install any libraries, django included, you may have to create a requirements file for other developers to work with your code such as your teacher.
Only 1 model is sufficient for this project, it is already too complicated with Django and its rules.
Harder and optional task
Please write tests (the django way).

## Install 
django  using the following command 
# pip install django
to find the django command you can use 

# python -m django --version  to check the Django version
#  Django-admin  this will show you all the sub commands of Django

##  Now we have to create a new app
##
# command how to startapp and name of the app EXAMPLE  
  # *THIS IS THE COMMAND (python manage.py startapp atomicity)*
